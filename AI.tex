 \emph{Artificial intelligence is the intelligence of machines and the branch of computer science that aims to create it. The field was founded on the claim that a central property of humans, ntelligence the sapience of Homo sapiens an be so precisely described that it can be simulated by a machine. This raises philosophical issues about the nature of the mind and limits of scientific hubris, issues which have been addressed by myth, fiction and philosophy since antiquity. Artificial intelligence has been the subject of optimism,but has also suffered setbacks and, today, has become an essential part of the technology industry, providing the heavy lifting for many of the most difficult problems in computer science.}

\section{Introduction}
Future trends in computer science is one of the artificial intelligence\cite{Yong2017}. As shown in Figure \ref{1}, it is the research and artificial simulation of human thought and eventually be able to make a human like to think the same machine. For human services and to help people solve problems. After all, people thought it was unique, there are feelings, there are a variety of character, this will be very difficult to achieve in the machine. In fact, to do the same as the human thinking machine,  the only one of the artificial intelligence, is by no means all. Through the study of artificial intelligence\cite{Goossens2000}.It can resolve all kinds of scientific problems, and promote the development of other science, the artificial intelligence is the best.Following the Table \ref{table1}, it shows application of company software.
\par I believe that the science of artificial intelligence is waiting for humanity to explore it step by step the real connotation.
