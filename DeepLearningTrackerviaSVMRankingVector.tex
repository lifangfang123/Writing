\begin{abstract}
The deep learning based trackers can always achieve high tracking
precision and strong adaptability in different scenarios. However, due
to the fact that the number of the parameter is large and the
fine-tuning is challenging, the time complexity is high. In order to
improve the efficiency, author proposed a tracker based on fast deep
learning through constructing a new network with less redundancy.
Based on the theory of deep learning, author proposed a deep neural
network to describe essential features of images. Furthermore, fast
deep learning can be achieved by restricting the size of network. With
the help of GPU, the time complexity of the network training is
released to a large extent.

Object tracking is an important branch of computer vision.
It plays a key role in many areas that contain objects

\section{The deep learning based feature extractor}
From a pattern recognition point of view, visual tracking is a model
The classification problem separates the goal from the background. The
Feature selection and extraction limit the execution of these tasks.
The author uses a deep learning method as a feature extractor, which is possible. Features are represented by multiple descriptions.


Automatic encoder is an important theoretical basis for deep learning
Consists of input, hidden layers, and output. The encoding and decoding
way is described as:
\begin{equation}
 h=sigm(Wx+b)
\end{equation} 	
\begin{equation}
\widehat{x}=sigm(W^Th+c)
\end{equation}

where $sigm(z)=\frac{1}{1+exp(-z)}$ denotes	the	sigmoid function, x
denotes the vector transformed from the input data. Different from the
traditional neural network, the weight matrix $W$ and $W^T$ are transposed. b
and c respectively denote the encoding bias and the decoding bias~\cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet}.
The autoencoder learning is aimed at reconstructing the input to a
maximum limit, which optimizes the target function:
\begin{equation}
min\sum_{i=1}^N||x^j-\widehat{x}^j||_{2}^2+η\left(
||W||_{F}^2+||W^T||_{F}^2  \right)
\end{equation}


The Denoising Autoencoder (DAE)~\cite{Ahmed2015An} put some noise into the input data
and thex is transformed to $\widehat{x}$, which is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\widehat{x}= x\times B
\end{equation}
Based on greedy algorithm, superimposed denoising automatic encoder (SDAE).
It's built with a few DAEs that have been trained in one step
step. The author uses this network to extract functionality. Where elements of the matrix B are sampled from a Bernoulli
distribution. The training process works similarly to AE as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:1}.
