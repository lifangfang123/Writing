People often start off their day by completing easy tasks to get themselves rolling, and leave their more difficult work for later. The table \ref{tab1} summarizes bad haits. This is a bad idea, and one that frequently leads to the important work not getting done at all. As researchers have found, people have a limited amount of willpower that decreases throughout the day, so it's best to get your hardest, most important tasks done at the beginning of the day. Maintaining energy levels requires eating a balanced lunch. High-fat, high-sugar lunches make us sleepy and have low energy by 3 pm, DeFazio says, so it's important to go heavy on the protein and healthy fats and easy on the carbs when choosing what you eat for lunch. Luckily, plenty of fast-food chains offer healthy meal options that won't make you pass out at your desk.\\

Another key to getting better sleep is not letting outside influencers impair your sleep.The figure \ref{1} shows disadvantages.The LED screens of our smartphones, tablets, and laptops, for example, give off what is called blue light, which studies have shown can damage vision and suppress production of melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate the sleep cycle. Research also suggests that people with lower melatonin levels are more prone to be depressed. As Lisa DeFazio, a healthy-lifestyle expert and registered dietitian, tells Business Insider, breakfast is the most important meal of the day. By the time you wake up, you likely haven't eaten for 10 or 12 hours, which is where breakfast got its name â€” it means "breaking the fast," DeFazio said. Your first meal of the day is what kick-starts your metabolism and replenishes blood-sugar levels so you can focus and be productive throughout the day. When blood sugar levels are low, DeFazio says, it's much harder to focus and you're more likely to feel tired, irritable, and impatient. \\
