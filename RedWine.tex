\par Red wine is worst alcohol for your skin, according to doctors. Indulging in a few glasses of wine or a couple of cocktails may be a necessary part of life but unfortunately, there are no real benefits to the habit. Speaking to Popsugar, Dr Sharkar revealed the unfiltered fermented grape juice can negatively impact your skin, especially if you have a condition such as rosacea. Additionally, red wine is likely to cause “flushing, redness, and blotchy skin.” Alcohol is a vasodilator, meaning it opens the blood vessels - which leads to a flushed appearance and a puffy complexion.Sugar is also the culprit in other alcoholic drinks, as it is the leading cause of inflammation from alcohol consumption. If you want to wake up bright-eyed and clear-skinned, your best bet is to avoid alcohol altogether, as all of it can contribute to temporary skin damage. But as long as you drink in moderation, drinking tons of water - as alcohol causes dehydration - and moisturising the morning after will go a long way.
