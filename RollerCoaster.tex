\title{British roller coaster uses screams to generate electricity}


\begin{document}


\maketitle
The beginning of the article writes,Scream if you want to... charge your phone.This sentence inspires my great curiosity.The article continues to write the reason for screaming.That's because there are devices on it that 'harvest kinetic energy'.I realize that it is originally using sound waves to generate electricity.Beasides,it is not only suck up the energy of screams, but that from g-force and vibrations, too.Britain is a reasonable use of resources.millennials' biggest fear is their phones running out of battery, so the device should prove popular.Since I don¡¯t understand the meaning of the Millennials, I went online and checked it.There is a special intergenerational term millennials (born in 1984-1995), and the English is 'Millennials'. The synonym Y generation indicates that he was born in the 20th century .The growth period of this generation almost coincided with the formation and rapid development of Internet/computer science. The term is also commonly used in Chinese media and sociology.I think that if the same equipment is installed on a roller coaster in China, it will certainly be welcomed by the general public.However, it has not been officially put into operation £¬but it is only in the testing phase.It will be available at the theme park for an initial trial period. If this proves successful, the technology may become a permanent fixture for the remainder of the 2018 season.If this device is used in playgrounds across the country, it will not be afraid that the mobile phone will be dead when playing.
I am looking forward to putting it into operation.
